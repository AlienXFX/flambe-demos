# Extensions demo

This demonstrates using AIR native extensions (ANE). To build with an
ANE, place it in your project's libs/ directory. You can also stick .swc
and .swf files in there for pure AS3 libraries.

This demo uses the official [Vibration extension] from Adobe. This
particular extension requires tweaking your flambe.yaml to enable the
VIBRATE permission on Android.

Try it out on [Android].
